<p>This is Amogh from hyderabad, India currently pursuing Master's degree
   in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University.
   when talking about my likes, I am very much fond of playing cricket and if not
   cricket I would probably watch new movies. An interesting fact about me is
   I can do continous push-ups upto about 50.</p>
<h2>Favorite Food</h2>
<p>My Favorite food is Chicken Biryani.
   I like it because it tastes delicious and like it even more when it is cooked by my mum.
   It's my all time favorite dish and whenever I eat I do it to my fullest. </p>
